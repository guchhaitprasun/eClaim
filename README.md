# eClaim Case Study ‚Äì Root Repository


## üìë Problem Statement
YCompany, with over 200M customers, is facing inefficiencies in its **manual claims processing system**:
- Claims take weeks to settle, causing customer dissatisfaction.  
- No real-time tracking for customers.  
- Manual processes for adjustors, surveyors, and workshops increase delays.  
- Lack of analytics, fraud detection, and reporting capabilities.  

The goal of this case study is to **modernize claims management** with a **scalable, secure, and cloud-ready digital solution** that delivers faster settlements, real-time transparency, and integration with partner ecosystems.
